\section{Introduction}
Observational studies and cosmological simulations have revealed a deep interconnection between galaxies and their central supermassive black hole (SMBH): they appear to coevolve and affect each other during their lives.
It has been reported several times that the SMBH mass correlates with a number of galaxy properties, including bulge mass, velocity dispersion, and S\'{e}rsic index. The relation with the velocity dispersion appears to the most fundamental relation so far \citep[e.g.,][]{2007ApJ...660..267B, 2016MNRAS.460.3119S, 2017MNRAS.466.4029S,2019MNRAS.485.1278S}.

Coincidentally, the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and black hole accretion rate densities (BHARD) share a similar evolution: they reach a peak of activity at redshift $z\sim2$ and then decrease to the present epoch \citep{1998MNRAS.293L..49B, 2014MNRAS.439.2736D, 2014ARA&A..52..415M}. Additionally, semianalytic models and hydrodynamic simulations show that a self-regulating mechanism is required between the star formation and the black hole accretion in order to reproduce local scaling relations \citep[see][for a review]{2015ARA&A..53...51S}.
        
    The history of star formation in galaxies throughout the life of the Universe has been thoroughly constrained in recent years \citep[see][for a review]{2014ARA&A..52..415M}: the SFRD of the Universe increased by a factor of about 10 since $z\sim8$, reached a peak at around $z\sim2$, and declined by a factor of 10 since then. This decline is thought to depend on the decreasing availability of cold gas that is required to form stars \citep[e.g.,][]{2016MNRAS.458L..14F}. In addition, we know that most galaxies follow a sequence on the stellar mass ($M_*$) - star formation rate (SFR) plane with an almost linear slope. The so-called \emph{\textup{main-sequence}} of star-forming galaxies \citep{2004MNRAS.351.1151B, 2007ApJ...670..156D, 2007A&A...468...33E, 2007ApJ...660L..43N, 2014MNRAS.443...19R, 2017MNRAS.465.3390A} suggests that most of the cosmic star formation takes place through secular processes \citep{2011ApJ...739L..40R} because it has been observed at all redshifts and shows no evolution in its slope, but an increasing normalization with redshift \citep{2015A&A...581A..54T, 2015A&A...575A..74S, 2016ApJ...817..118T}: at earlier epochs, galaxies of a given stellar mass were forming more stars than in the local Universe.
    We also find that a number of galaxies lie substantially above and below the MS.
    Starburst galaxies are a small fraction of star-forming galaxies \citep[$\sim2\%$][]{2011ApJ...739L..40R}, and their SFRs and gas fractions are higher than those on the MS. 
    Quiescent galaxies, on the other hand, lie below the main-sequence and therefore have little star formation. They have been shown to evolve from $z\sim1.8,$ where they have significant amounts of dust and gas ($\sim5-10\%$) but their star formation efficiency is low, to the local universe, where they are gas poor \citep{2018NatAs...2..239G}.
    
    Just like star formation, black hole accretion depends on the availability of cold gas. Simulations show that gas flows into galaxies, where it cools to eventually fuel star formation and black hole accretion \citep{2010MNRAS.407.1529H}. This fueling by gas is expected to be even more pronounced in starburst galaxies, many of which are likely to undergo a major merging event \citep{2005Natur.433..604D, 2008ApJS..175..356H}: During the early stages of galaxy merging, gas can efficiently cool and lose angular momentum, eventually feeding central star formation and black hole growth. 
    The black hole accretion is initially obscured by thick layers of dust, which are then possibly removed by its increasing radiation and momentum feedback, revealing the quasar. Eventually, the gas is consumed, the quasar luminosity fades rapidly, and the star formation episode ceases. This leaves a "red and dead" elliptical galaxy with no or very little star formation or black hole accretion \citep{2004ApJ...600..580G, 2006ApJ...650...42L}.
    
    This picture might suggest that just like the majority of galaxies follow a main-sequence in the SFR-$M_*$ plane, a similar relation between the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) and the $M_*$ might exist: the more massive the galaxy, the higher the availability of inflowing gas  for star formation and black hole accretion, which would mean that they both should correlate with stellar mass. In addition, galaxies offset from the main-sequence (starbursts and quiescents), might have a BHAR that varies accordingly with the gas that is typically available in that phase \citep{2019ApJ...877L..38R}. 
    
    In order to search for these potential correlations, many authors have used the X-ray luminosity of galaxies as a proxy of BHAR: X-rays are very energetic photons that are created very close to the central SMBH, and other contaminants in the host galaxies at these wavelengths, for example, emission from stellar processes or binary systems, are usually less powerful and not dominant \citep[see the review by][]{2015A&ARv..23....1B}. Nevertheless, the first studies that traced the instantaneous BHAR with X-ray flux failed at finding any BHAR-M$_*$ relation \citep{2009ApJ...696..396S, 2010A&A...518L..26S, 2012MNRAS.419...95M, 2012A&A...545A..45R, 2015ApJ...806..187A}. A lack of a correlation between SFR and BHAR does not by itself necessarily imply a lack of physical connection. It might arise, for example, from different duty cycles and variabilities that characterize the two processes.  
    Episodes of star formation last for several Gyr, while the SMBH duty cycles are believed to be very short, with accretion episodes of about $10^5$~yr and variability timescales that range from minutes to months.
    
    In order to constrain more robust and reliable BHAR, 
    it is thus necessary to average their growth rate over a long time interval. A very promising technique to achieve this goal consists of stacking X-ray images. 
    Stacking allows us to perform studies on mass-complete samples by averaging the count rates of the X-ray images in the optical positions of the galaxies, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, and allowing us to reach fluxes well below the single-source detection threshold of the observations. Moreover, because the BHAR is a stochastic event, stacking large samples of galaxies in a given volume is equivalent to averaging the growth rate of all galaxies.
    Previous works indeed searched for a relation between M$_*$ and average BHAR by stacking X-ray images \citep[e.g.,][]{2012ApJ...753L..30M, 2015ApJ...800L..10R, 2017ApJ...842...72Y}, and the probability distribution of specific X-ray luminosity with a maximum likelihood approach \citep{2012ApJ...746...90A, 2012MNRAS.427.3103B, 2018MNRAS.475.1887Y} and a Bayesian approach \citep{2018MNRAS.474.1225A}. All studies point toward a positive correlation between the BHAR and the M$_*$ for star-forming galaxies, very similar to the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies, with a slope close to unity, non-negligible redshift evolution, a positive slope for the BHAR-to-SFR ratio as a function of stellar mass, and indications of different behaviors for quiescent and starburst galaxies. 
    Thus far, no study has presented a complete analysis throughout all galaxy life phases by highlighting the evolution of the accretions and their ratio throughout cosmic time. This is what we present here. So far, only \citet{2019MNRAS.484.4360A} have shown that the fraction of active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies is higher below the main-sequence and in starbursts.
        
        We here characterize the evolution of the average BHAR for normal star-forming, quiescent, and starburst galaxies at $0.1<z<3.5$. This redshift interval encompasses the majority of the history of the Universe and contains two crucial epochs in its evolution: the peak of the star formation rate density and BHAR of the Universe at z$\sim$2, and their decline to the local Universe.
        We take advantage of the unique depth, area, and wavelength coverage of the COSMOS field, which allows us to select a mass-complete sample with large statistics out to very high redshifts for each galaxy phase. This is particularly important for starbursts, which are rare objects and require a large field in order to be found in good numbers for statistics. We apply the stacking technique to X-ray images from the \textit{Chandra} COSMOS-Legacy survey \citep{2016ApJ...819...62C} and combine the results with the actual X-ray detections in order to estimate the average X-ray luminosity and therefore average BHAR. We compare the evolution of the average BHAR with that of the average SFR. We show that these data confirm and extend previous claims about the evolution of the specific accretions and that the ratio of BHAR to SFR and M$_*$ are correlated. More specifically, in Section
 \ref{sec:data} we introduce the parent data sample we used for this work, from which we select the sample as described in Section \ref{sec:sample}. In Section \ref{sec:method} we describe the method we used to estimate the average X-ray luminosities, BHAR and SFR. In Sections~\ref{sec:L_X} and~\ref{sec:BH_SF} we describe our results and discuss them. In Section~\ref{sec:specifics} we describe the derivation of specific BHAR and specific SFR and discuss the respective results. In Section~\ref{sec:M_vs_M} we compare our M$_\text{BH}$-M$_*$ relation to observational and simulation relations. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we enumerate the conclusions of this work.
   
Throughout this paper we use a \citet{2003PASP..115..763C} initial mass function (IMF) assuming a flat cosmology with $H_0=70$, $\Omega_\lambda=0.7$, $\Omega_0=0.3$.
