\section{Introduction}
Observational studies and cosmological simulations have revealed a deep interconnection between galaxies and their central supermassive black hole (SMBH): they appear to coevolve and affect each other during their lives.
It has been reported several times that the SMBH mass (M$_{\rm BH}$) correlates with a number of galaxy properties, including bulge mass, velocity dispersion, and S\'{e}rsic index. The existence of these relations is not trivial to explain since the SMBH has a very small sphere of influence compared to the galaxy size. While it is relatively easy to explain that gas inflows from the intergalactic medium can feed the star formation in what we call secular processes, it is not easy to understand how the gas loses angular momentum and funnels to the center of the galaxy to feed the SMBH \citep{2019NatAs...3...48S}. %{\bf explicitar que estas relaciones no son obvias, el BH es demasiado pequeño para influenciar directamente la dinámica de la galaxia.} %The relation with the velocity dispersion appears to the most fundamental relation so far \citep[e.g.,][]{2007ApJ...660..267B, 2016MNRAS.460.3119S, 2017MNRAS.466.4029S,2019MNRAS.485.1278S}.
By modeling the selection bias that leads to the M$_{\rm BH}$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and M$_{\rm BH}$-galaxy bulge luminosity from optical or NIR bands $L$, \citet{2007ApJ...660..267B} have shown that the most fundamental relation is between M$_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ while the relation between M$_{\rm BH}- L$ is a consequence of a relation between $\sigma-L$ and is therefore more biased, as it predicts more massive BHs at a given luminosity.{\bf poner un par de oraciones explicando qué es el bias y por qué importa. RC: No entiendo. Si algo està biased significa que està equivocado y para que esté lo màs correcto posible es importante minimizar los bias. Pero eso es algo que cada astrónomo/físico debería saber. A qué te refieres?} Also \citet{2017MNRAS.466.4029S} showed that M$_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ is the most fundamental in the scaling relations between black holes and galaxies by studying the residuals of the relations between M$_{\rm BH}$ and $\sigma$, S\'{e}rsic index $n$ and M$_{\rm bulge}$ in SDSS galaxies. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations have shown that a bias can be introduced when dynamically measuring M$_{\rm BH}$: the requirement that the black hole sphere of influence must be resolved to measure black hole masses leads to an increased M$_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relation of at least a factor three \citep{2016MNRAS.460.3119S}.

%\citet{2016MNRAS.460.3119S} found through Monte Carlo simulations that a bias can be introduced when dynamically measuring M$_{\rm BH}$: the requirement that the black hole sphere of influence must be resolved to measure black hole masses leads to an increased M$_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relation of at least a factor three. 
%\citet{2017MNRAS.466.4029S} lead a study in which they studied the residuals of the relations between M$_{\rm BH}$ and $\sigma$, S\'{e}rsic index $n$ and M$_{\rm bulge}$ in SDSS galaxies, and find that $\sigma$ is the most fundamental in the scaling relations between black holes and galaxies.

Interesting insight in this respect has been gained by studying the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and black hole accretion rate densities (BHARD), which are the amount of star formation and black hole accretion per unit of comoving volume at a given redshift. With the fundamental contribution from deep and wide field surveys it has been possible to study them thoroughly and to unveil their evolution.
The BHARD has been determined from the IR (up to $z\sim3$, using and \emph{Herschel} data, \citet{2014MNRAS.439.2736D}) and X-ray observations (up to $z\sim 6$ wide and deep surveys from XMM and Chandra, \citet{2018MNRAS.473.2378V}). 
The history of star formation in galaxies throughout the life of the Universe has been thoroughly constrained in recent years: it can be estimated from the UV emission of the massive and short-lived stars, but a fraction of it is absorbed by the dust present in the galaxy and then re-emitted in the IR, therefore the SFRD has been studied through infrared data with \emph{Herschel}, ultraviolet data with \emph{Galaxy Evolution Explorer} (GALEX) \citep[see][for a review]{2014ARA&A..52..415M} and more recently complemented by sub-mm ALMA data, especially at high redshift up to $z\sim10$ \citep{2020ApJ...902..112B,2020A&A...643A...8G}. %For both SFRD and BHARD the contribution from deep and wide field surveys has been of crucial importance. 
All of these studies have shown that both BHARD and SFRD reach a peak of activity at redshift $z\sim2$ and then decrease to the present epoch \citep{1998MNRAS.293L..49B}.

Additionally, semianalytic models and hydrodynamic simulations show that a self-regulating mechanism, the so called feedback, is required between the star formation and the black hole accretion in order to reproduce local scaling relations, i.e. relations that describe strong trends that are observed between important physical properties of galaxies %{\bf definir scaling relations o al menos recordar lo de arriba y decir relacion entre BH mass y host galaxy properties.}
\citep[see][for a review]{2015ARA&A..53...51S}. Since the pioneering models of galaxy evolution in a cold dark matter framework it was clear that there was an ``overcooling problem'': most of the gas should have cooled and condensed into stars by the present day while it is observed that less than 10\% of it is in the shape of stars, so some suppression of cooling and star formation had to be introduced. This could be as energy released by supernovae \citep{1974MNRAS.169..229L,1978MNRAS.183..341W,1986ApJ...303...39D,1991ApJ...379...52W} and the impact of this phenomenon would be important in regulating star formation in low mass galaxies. On the other hand, luminosity functions predict more high luminosity galaxies in the local universe then we observe, and this might be prevented from happening through feedback from the SMBH as it actively accretes gas, which is called an active galactic nucleus (AGN).%{\bf definir AGN y feedback}
The infalling gas will produce an optically thick of material, an accretion disk, that will emit thermally as a black body because of its own viscosity \citep[e.g.][]{1973A&A....24..337S,1984ARA&A..22..471R}. The temperature of the gas will increase as it approaches the SMBH and in a typical AGN will range at $T \approx 10^3-10^4 K$ corresponding to a majority of the emission at $\approx 30-300 nm$. %AGN also emit in the X-rays, IR and in the radio. The X-ray emission is thought to originate in a corona above the accretion disk by inverse Compton scattering. The IR emission is reprocessed emission from torus and radio from non thermal bremsstrahlung.
The accretion of gas in the BH is an very efficient process, and a fraction of $\approx 5-45\%$, depending on the spin of the black hole \citep[e.g.][]{1963PhRvL..11..237K,1983bhwd.book.....S}, will be emitted as electromagnetic radiation, thereby allowing for very high AGN luminosities.
Simple calculations have shown that when the black hole becomes sufficiently massive ($> 10^7 M_\odot$) its maximum accretion luminosity, the Eddington %{\bf definir Eddington, o decir simplemente maximum accretion luminosity, definir accretion, en realidad, antes de hablar de esto poner qué es un AGN y por qué brilla y por qué podría afectar a su galaxia, ponle un parrafito sobre esto.}
luminosity, becomes high enough that its winds could in principle blow out the entire galaxy %{\bf el gas nomás espero} 
\citep{1998A&A...331L...1S}. This feedback mode, called quasar mode, prevents star formation by delivering momentum to the galactic gas and removing it. There is also a radio mode in which the BH is in a low accretion mode and heats the gas, thereby preventing it from collapsing and forming new stars \citep{2017NatAs...1E.165H}.
    
    %the SFRD of the Universe increased by a factor of about 10 since $z\sim8$, reached a peak at around $z\sim2$, and declined by a factor of 10 since then. 
    The decline of the SFRD at low redshift is thought to depend on the decreasing availability of cold gas that is required to form stars and accrete onto black holes \citep[e.g.,][]{2016MNRAS.458L..14F}. In addition, we know that most galaxies form an amount of new stars that is proportional to the amount of stars that is already present in the galaxy, thereby creating a sequence on the stellar mass ($M_*$) - star formation rate (SFR) plane with an almost linear relation%{\bf un poco más explícito: algo como que se observa que mientras más masa estelar tiene la galaxia, más estrellas está formando por unidad de tiempo, con una relación casi lineal}
    . The so-called \emph{\textup{main-sequence}} of star-forming galaxies \citep{2004MNRAS.351.1151B, 2007ApJ...670..156D, 2007A&A...468...33E, 2007ApJ...660L..43N, 2014MNRAS.443...19R, 2017MNRAS.465.3390A} suggests that most of the cosmic star formation takes place through secular %{\bf secular en oposición a qué, puedes explicar un poco más, como si hay dos corrientes posibles, que las estrellas se formen en bursts por mergers o algo o todo el tiempo por procesos seculares y que estas relaciones indican que es principalmente seculares} 
    processes in a quasi-steady mode instead of during stochastic and short-lived episodes of considerable galaxy growth like major mergers \citep{2011ApJ...739L..40R}. This belief is particularly reinforced by the observation of the main sequence at all redshifts and that it shows no evolution in its slope, just an increasing normalization with redshift \citep{2015A&A...581A..54T, 2015A&A...575A..74S, 2016ApJ...817..118T}: at earlier epochs, galaxies of a given stellar mass were forming more stars than in the local Universe.
    We also find that a number of galaxies lie substantially above and below the MS.
    Starburst galaxies are a small fraction of star-forming galaxies \citep[$\sim2\%$][]{2011ApJ...739L..40R}, and their SFRs and gas fractions are higher than those on the MS at the same stellar mass. 
    Quiescent galaxies, on the other hand, lie below the main-sequence and therefore have little star formation. They have been shown to evolve from $z\sim1.8,$ where they have significant amounts of dust and gas ($\sim5-10\%$) but their star formation efficiency is low, to the local universe, where they are gas poor \citep{2018NatAs...2..239G}.
    
    Just like star formation, black hole accretion depends on the availability of cold gas. 
    In a classic evolutionary picture predicted by simulations one could have a star forming disk galaxy on the main sequence which undergoes a major merging event \citep{2005Natur.433..604D, 2008ApJS..175..356H}: During the early stages of galaxy merging, gas can efficiently cool and lose angular momentum, eventually feeding black hole growth and central star formation, producing a starburst. The black hole accretion is initially obscured by thick layers of dust, which are then possibly removed by its increasing radiation and momentum feedback, revealing the quasar. Eventually, the gas is consumed, the quasar luminosity fades rapidly, and the star formation episode ceases. This leaves a "red and dead" elliptical galaxy with no or very little star formation or black hole accretion \citep{2004ApJ...600..580G, 2006ApJ...650...42L}. This picture seems to be validated by low redshift (ultra) luminous IR galaxies ((U)LIRGs) which are starburst galaxies often undergoing a major merger event \citep{1996ARA&A..34..749S}, but it seems that this does not apply to higher redshift galaxies, as many of these don't show signs of a disturbed morphology \citep{2007A&A...468...33E, 2019ApJ...877L..38R}. 
    Other theoretical models have predicted pictures of an in situ co-evolution scenario in which SF and black hole accretion are fed by the gas already present in the galaxy and triggered by the early collapse of the host dark matter halos  \citep[e.g.][]{2006ApJ...650...42L, 2011ApJ...742...24L, 2014ApJ...782...69L, 2013ApJ...772..119L,2015ApJ...810...74A, 2016ApJ...833..152M} and/or steady cold gas streams along filaments of the cosmic web  \citep[e.g.][]{2009Natur.457..451D, 2011ApJ...741L..33B}. The accretions are subsequently controlled by self-regulated baryonic physics and in particular by energy feedback from supernovae (SNe) and AGNs. In this picture starbursts are gas rich young galaxies, placed to the left of the main sequence (as opposed to \textit{above}). These galaxies then evolve at about a constant SFR while increasing their stellar masses, thus reaching the main sequence locus \citep{2016ApJ...833..152M, 2018ApJ...857...22L}. Additionally wang19 \citet{2019MNRAS.482.4454W} find in their semi-analytic models of galaxy formation that not all galaxies in the starburst locus have recently undergone a major merger and that not all the galaxies which have undergone a major merger event result in a starburst.
    Observational results are still not capable to discern between these evolutionary scenarios as deep high resolution data for large statistical samples of starbursts are needed. and future facilities are most likely to provide them. %{\bf no me queda claro si esta evolución es una predicción, informada por sims o datos o ambos o está todo comprobado}.
    
    These pictures might suggest that just like the majority of galaxies follow a main-sequence in the SFR-$M_*$ plane, a similar relation between the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) and the $M_*$ might exist: the more massive the galaxy, the higher the availability of inflowing gas for star formation and black hole accretion, which would mean that they both should correlate with stellar mass. In addition, galaxies offset from the main-sequence (starbursts and quiescents), might have a BHAR that varies accordingly with the gas that is typically available in that phase \citep{2019ApJ...877L..38R}. 
    
    In order to search for these potential correlations, many authors have used the X-ray luminosity of galaxies as a proxy of BHAR: X-rays are very energetic photons that are created very close to the central SMBH, and other contaminants in the host galaxies at these wavelengths, for example, emission from stellar processes or binary systems, are usually less powerful and not dominant \citep[e.g.][]{2015A&ARv..23....1B}. Nevertheless, the first studies that traced the instantaneous BHAR with X-ray flux failed at finding any BHAR-M$_*$ relation \citep{2009ApJ...696..396S, 2010A&A...518L..26S, 2012MNRAS.419...95M, 2012A&A...545A..45R, 2015ApJ...806..187A}. A lack of a correlation between SFR and BHAR does not by itself necessarily imply a lack of physical connection. It might arise, for example, from different duty cycles and variabilities that characterize the two processes.  
    Episodes of star formation last for several Gyr, while the SMBH duty cycles are believed to be very short, with accretion episodes of about $10^5$~yr and variability timescales that range from minutes to months.
    
    In order to constrain more robust and reliable BHAR, 
    it is thus necessary to average their growth rate over a long time interval. A very promising technique to achieve this goal consists of stacking X-ray images. Since the BHAR is a stochastic event, stacking large samples of galaxies in a given volume, by grouping them based on optical properties, e.g. the stellar mass,  is equivalent to averaging the growth rate of all galaxies.
    Furthermore stacking allows us to perform studies on mass-complete samples by averaging the count rates of the X-ray images in the optical positions of the galaxies, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, and allowing us to reach fluxes well below the single-source detection threshold of the observations. %{\bf poner en otra oracion que el stacking se hace para galaxias con las mismas caracteristicas opticas, que quede claro que no se está mezclando todo} {\bf pondría esto último primero, que es lo esencial para calcular el crecimiento promedio}
    Previous works indeed searched for a relation between M$_*$ and average BHAR by stacking X-ray images \citep[e.g.,][]{2012ApJ...753L..30M, 2015ApJ...800L..10R, 2017ApJ...842...72Y}, and the probability distribution of specific X-ray luminosity (X-ray luminosity divided by galaxy stellar mass) %{\bf per galaxy? per bin?} 
    with a maximum likelihood approach \citep{2012ApJ...746...90A, 2012MNRAS.427.3103B, 2018MNRAS.475.1887Y} and a Bayesian approach \citep{2018MNRAS.474.1225A}. All studies point toward a positive correlation between the BHAR and the M$_*$ for star-forming galaxies, very similar to the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies, with a slope close to unity, non-negligible redshift evolution, a positive slope for the BHAR-to-SFR ratio as a function of stellar mass, and indications of different behaviors for quiescent and starburst galaxies. 
    Thus far, no study has presented a complete analysis throughout all galaxy life phases by highlighting the evolution of the accretions and the BHAR-to-SFR ratio throughout cosmic time. This is what we present here, in order to understand if the efficiencies of gas conversion in the black hole correspond to those of the star formation, how they vary with time, stellar mass and especially with galaxy life phase. %{\bf pon más explicitamente que interrogante se va a responder con este analisis más completo, aunque sea en varias oraciones. Hay teorías alternativas que se van a probar?} 
    So far, only \citet{2019MNRAS.484.4360A} have shown that the fraction of AGN galaxies is higher below the main-sequence and in starbursts than in the main sequence. %{\bf and SF's?, aquí veremos qué pasa en las otras fases? para restingir qué cosa?}.
        
        We here characterize the evolution of the average BHAR for normal star-forming, quiescent, and starburst galaxies at $0.1<z<3.5$. This redshift interval encompasses the majority of the history of the Universe and contains two crucial epochs in its evolution: the peak of the star formation rate density and BHAR of the Universe at z$\sim$2, and their decline to the local Universe.
        We take advantage of the unique depth, area, and wavelength coverage of the COSMOS field, which allows us to select a mass-complete sample with large statistics out to very high redshifts for each galaxy phase. This is particularly important for starbursts, which are rare objects and require a large field in order to be found in good numbers for statistics. We apply the stacking technique to X-ray images from the \textit{Chandra} COSMOS-Legacy survey \citep{2016ApJ...819...62C} and combine the results with the actual X-ray detections in order to estimate the average X-ray luminosity and therefore average BHAR. We compare the evolution of the average BHAR with that of the average SFR. We show that these data confirm and extend previous claims about the evolution of the specific accretions and that the ratio of BHAR to SFR and M$_*$ are correlated. 
%More specifically, in Section \ref{sec:data} we introduce the parent data sample we used for this work, from which we select the sample as described in Section \ref{sec:sample}. In Section \ref{sec:method} we describe the method we used to estimate the average X-ray luminosities, BHAR and SFR. In Sections~\ref{sec:L_X} and~\ref{sec:BH_SF} we describe our results and discuss them. In Section~\ref{sec:specifics} we describe the derivation of specific BHAR and specific SFR and discuss the respective results. In Section~\ref{sec:M_vs_M} we compare our M$_\text{BH}$-M$_*$ relation to observational and simulation relations. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we enumerate the conclusions of this work.
   
%Throughout this paper we use a \citet{2003PASP..115..763C} initial mass function (IMF) assuming a flat cosmology with $H_0=70$, $\Omega_\lambda=0.7$, $\Omega_0=0.3$.
